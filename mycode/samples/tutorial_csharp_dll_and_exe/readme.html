        <H1>C# Instrumentation Sample of an Application and a DLL</H1>

        <h2>Setup</H2>
        Use "<TT>Start&rarr;Squish Coco&rarr;Build Environment Selection</TT>"
        to select the Visual Studio toolchain to use.

        <h2>Compiling</H2>
        "<TT>Step 1 Build With Command Line Compiler</TT>" build:
                <UL>
                    <LI><TT>hellodll.dll</TT> and <TT>hellodll.dll.csmes</TT>
                    which contains the instrumented code of
                    <TT>hello.cs</TT></LI>

                    <LI><TT>hello.exe</TT> and <TT>hello.exe.csmes</TT> which
                    contains the instrumented code of <TT>hello.cs</TT>
                    (included automatically when linking again
                    <TT>hellodll.dll</TT>) and <TT>tutorial.cs</TT></LI>
                </UL>

        <h2>Executing</H2>

        <h3>Manual Execution</H3>
        "<TT>Step 2 Execute Application</TT>" opens a console window which
        permits to execute <TT>hello.exe</TT>.
        After each execution of it, a file <TT>hello.exe.csexe</TT> is
        generated which is the execution report.

        <h3>Batch Execution</H3>
        "<TT>Step 2 Execute Test Suite</TT>" is a small batch file which
        execute several times  <TT>hello.exe</TT>. This batch file also set the
        execution name and the status (passed/fail) of each run.


        <h2>Coverage Analysis</H2>

        <h3>Main Application and DLL</h3>
        "<TT>Step 3 Code Coverage Analysis of hello.exe</TT>" opens
        CoverageBrowser and permits to analyze the code coverage of the code in
        the DLL (<TT>hellodll.dll</TT>) and the main application (<TT>hello.exe</TT>).

        <h3>DLL Only</h3>
        "<TT>Step 3 Code Coverage Analysis of hellodll.dll only</TT>" opens
        CoverageBrowser and permits to analyze the code coverage of the code in
        the DLL (<TT>hellodll.dll</TT>) only.
