        <H1>C# Instrumentation Sample of a DLL only</H1>

        <h2>Setup</H2>
        Use "<TT>Start&rarr;Squish Coco&rarr;Build Environment Selection</TT>"
        to select the Visual Studio toolchain to use.

        <h2>Compiling</H2>
        "<TT>Step 1 Build With Command Line Compiler</TT>" build:
        <UL>
            <LI><TT>hellodll.dll</TT> and <TT>hellodll.dll.csmes</TT>
            which contains the instrumented code of
            <TT>hello.cs</TT></LI>

            <LI><TT>hello.exe</TT> which is build but not instrumented </LI>
        </UL>

        To work properly, it is necessary to execute <TT>InjectModuleInitializer.exe</TT> on <TT>hellodll.dll</TT>.
        This permits to initialize the CoverageScanner library of a DLL.

        <h2>Executing</H2>

        <h3>Manual Execution</H3>
        "<TT>Step 2 Execute Application</TT>" opens a console window which
        permits to execute <TT>hello.exe</TT>.
        After each execution of it, a file <TT>hellodll.dll.csexe</TT> is
        generated which is the execution report.

        <h3>Batch Execution</H3>
        "<TT>Step 2 Execute Test Suite</TT>" is a small batch file which
        execute several times  <TT>hello.exe</TT>. This batch file also set the
        execution name and the status (passed/fail) of each run.


        <h2>Coverage Analysis</H2>

        "<TT>Step 3 Code Coverage Analysis of hellodll.dll only</TT>" opens
        CoverageBrowser and permits to analyze the code coverage of the code in
        the DLL (<TT>hellodll.dll</TT>) only.
