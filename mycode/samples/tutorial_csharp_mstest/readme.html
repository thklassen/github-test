<H1>Instrumenting The C# Library</H1>
<P>
Instrument the C# <TT>Tutorial.DLL</TT> library by adding <TT>COVERAGESCANNER_COVERAGE_ON</TT> to the conditional compilation symbols. The test DLL may not be instrumented.
</p>

<H1>Recording The Code Coverage for Each Unit Test</H1>

<P>
To record the code coverage for each single unit test it is necessary to modify the tests as followings:
<UL>
    <LI> The unit test should be inherit the class <TT>Coverage</TT> </LI>
    <LI> Add to the member <TT>TestContext</TT> the attribute <TT>override</TT> </LI>
</LI>
</UL>
</p>

<P>
The <TT>Coverage</TT> class will record the code coverage of each C# unit test
for the instrumented code which is executed.

Its code  is provided as sample in the file
<tt>coverge.cs</tt> and should be adapted to the projects needs.

        If an unit test does not inherit <TT>Coverage</TT>, then all coverage informations are stored in one execution report called <TT>"unknown"</TT>.
